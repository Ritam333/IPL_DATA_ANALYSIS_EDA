  - "Royal Challenger Bangalore" was corrected to "Royal Challengers Bangalore".
  - "M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru" TO "M Chinnaswamy Stadium"
  - ETC...

### Visualizations
The data was visualized using **Plotly Express** and **Plotly Graph Objects** to create interactive and insightful charts and graphs. These visualizations help in understanding the data trends and key metrics.

   - To visualize trends over time (e.g., total runs per season).  
  
2. **Bar Graphs:**  
   - For comparisons like top players by runs or wickets.
